# Indigenous Cultural Alignment app

*Last reviewed: April 2026*

**A repository of culturally responsive AI review prompts to help professionals ensure their work is respectful and aligned with Indigenous frameworks, laws, and cultural protocols.**

## Why this project exists

Professionals across the world often want to "do the right thing" when working with Indigenous communities, but many feel a sense of **cultural anxiety** - a fear of making a mistake that leads to inaction or superficial engagement.

This project bridges the gap between **intent** and **action**. By surfacing credible, existing frameworks and posing thought-provoking questions, these prompts help you identify cultural risks and opportunities *before* you engage with a community.

> **Important**: These prompts are a **pre-engagement tool**. They do not replace real relationships or the authority of Indigenous communities. The AI does not speak for these communities; it surfaces named, verifiable sources to help you think more deeply.

## How to Use

### 1. Select Your prompt
Choose the community and version that fits your needs:
- **General Review Prompt**: For reviewing documents or products against publicly known legislation and cultural guidelines.
- **Workplace Review Prompt**: For cross-referencing work against both external frameworks and your organisation's internal policies (e.g., RAPs, Māori strategies).

### 2. Option A) Copy and paste
Paste the prompt into your AI assistant (optimised for **Claude**, compatible with ChatGPT and Gemini).

### 2. Option B) Use with Claude projects (recommended)
You can upload the `.md` files directly to a **Claude Project** to provide persistent cultural context for your entire workspace.

### 4. Provide context
Answer the AI's intake questions (Role, Industry, Region, etc.) and provide the content you want to review.

### 5. Review and act
The AI will provide observations, provocations, and a **Confidence Score**. Use this feedback to refine your work and guide your real-world engagement. Treat outputs as guidance and questions, not final answers.

## Data Safety and Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS)

**CRITICAL**: When using these prompts, you must respect Indigenous Data Sovereignty. 
- **Do NOT** upload sensitive, sacred, or private community documents to a public AI assistant without explicit community consent.
- **Anonymise** names and specific locations if you are unsure about the data's sensitivity.
- **Check your organisation's AI policy** regarding the use of third-party LLMs for community-related work.

The AI assistant is a **pre-engagement tool**. It is designed to help you *prepare* for a conversation, not to store or manage community knowledge.

## Methodology and Trust

This project is built on a foundation of professional expertise and technical rigor.

- **Expert-led**: Created by [Amy Heritage], a Fijian professional with over 10 years of experience in Indigenous affairs across NZ, Australia, and Canada.
- **Expert-validated**: Rigorously reviewed through an internal **11-expert validation panel** using maintainer-created synthetic personas informed by public scholarship and frameworks; this does not indicate endorsement, affiliation, or direct participation by named individuals.
- **Technically robust**: Uses advanced LLM techniques like **Chain of Thought (CoT)** and **Confidence Scoring** to minimise hallucination.

## Web App

A minimal web interface is available in the `app/` directory. It uses the Claude API to run reviews directly in your browser — no copy-pasting required.

### Setup

```bash
cd app
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Add your Anthropic API key to .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Select a region, choose General or Workplace review, paste or upload your document, and run the review. For Workplace reviews, a second input appears for your organisational strategies and policies.

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, an Anthropic API key.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this a replacement for community engagement?**
No. This tool is designed to help you *prepare* for engagement. It helps you identify the right questions to ask and the right frameworks to respect, so your real-world conversations are more informed and respectful.

**Can I trust the AI's cultural advice?**
The AI is constrained to surface only named, verifiable frameworks (e.g., UNDRIP, TRC, Te Tiriti). We have implemented a "Confidence Score" so the AI can tell you when it lacks enough context to provide a reliable review.

**Who owns the output?**
You do. The AI is a supportive peer looking over your shoulder. It provides observations and questions, but the final thinking and output belongs to you.
